# Channels

**Same brain, same memory, everywhere your team works.**

A channel in MateClaw is a different door into the same agent. Your team chats in Feishu? Put an agent in Feishu. Someone prefers Telegram? Same agent, same memory, in Telegram. Web console for the operators, DingTalk for the field, Slack for engineering — one deployment, nine doors.

Every channel is an adapter. Underneath the adapter, the agent doesn't know (or care) which door the message came through.

::: tip 1.3.0 channel-layer hardening
v1.3.0 lands a wave of long-run stability and group-collaboration work in the channel layer:

- **Reply queue + lifecycle gate** — separates "channel connection ready" from "messages dispatchable"; events received during a reconnect window are no longer dropped
- **WS / long-polling channels run on a leader lease** — in multi-instance deployments, only the lease holder replies; the **same inbound message no longer gets answered twice by different nodes**
- **Group-chat per-sender attribution + debounce boundary** — two people talking in the same group no longer get their messages mixed up
- **Adaptive debounce window for paste-split long messages** — a long paste broken into five messages auto-merges back into one
- **WeCom approval cards + keepalive + chunk dedup** — long-task cards survive upstream session timeouts
- **Async tool results forward back to the originating channel** — employee runs a long task, the result lands in Feishu / DingTalk / WeCom / Slack with files uploaded per-channel
- **Scrubbed fake generated-file URLs** — employees no longer hand back `https://example.com/file.docx`-style fictitious links

WeCom-specific tuning lives in [WeCom deep tuning](./wecom-tuning).

## How a channel actually works

```

Every channel implements a unified adapter shape — translating platform-specific events into messages the agent can consume. **Adding a new channel** is a developer task; see [Architecture](./architecture).

### Channel health monitor

Every active IM channel adapter is watched by a health monitor. When an adapter fails to connect or loses its long connection, the monitor kicks off **exponential backoff reconnect** (2s → 4s → 8s → … capped at 30s). Transient blips self-heal; persistent failures surface in the health view on the admin console.

This is why MateClaw channels don't sit silent after a hiccup: they come back on their own.

---

## Channel configuration basics

Channels are managed through **Channel Management** in the admin UI. The underlying row in `mate_channel`:

| Column | What it is |
|--------|-----------|
| `name` | Display name |
| `type` | Channel type (`dingtalk`, `feishu`, `telegram`, …) |
| `agent_id` | Which agent handles messages |
| `config` | JSON object with channel-specific credentials |
| `enabled` | On/off switch |

All credentials encrypted at rest. One agent can have many channels; different channels can talk to different agents.

---

## Web Channel (SSE)

Built in. No setup, no credentials. Uses Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming.

```
GET /api/v1/chat/{agentId}/stream
```

Event format documented in [Chat & Messaging](./chat).

---

## DingTalk

Two connection modes (Stream / Webhook) and two message formats (markdown / card).

### One-click QR binding (recommended, v1.1.0+)

**No developer console login. No "add Robot capability." No "create version." Open the channel form, scan a QR, done.**

1. `Channels → New → choose type: DingTalk`
2. In the form, click **Bind DingTalk App via QR** — a DingTalk-blue QR code unfolds
3. Scan it with the DingTalk app and **confirm authorization**
4. Back in the form, **Client ID and Client Secret are auto-filled**

Sessions are valid for 7 minutes; expired sessions auto-invalidate and regenerate. Fill in the rest (connection mode, agent, message format) as you'd like.

::: tip What's happening under the hood
DingTalk's OAuth Device Flow. MateClaw requests a device code from `oapi.dingtalk.com`, encodes it as a QR; once you confirm, credentials land in the form via the polling endpoint. **No webhook, no public IP required.**
:::

### Manual app creation (fallback)

If the QR flow can't reach DingTalk on your network, or you need finer control over the app config, the open-platform path still works:

1. Open [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/), **App Development > Internal Apps > Create App**
   ![Create App](/images/channels/dingtalk/01-create-app.png)

2. **App Capabilities > Add Capability** → add **Robot**
   ![Add Robot](/images/channels/dingtalk/02-add-bot.png)

3. Set message receiving mode to **Stream mode**, publish
   ![Robot Config](/images/channels/dingtalk/03-bot-config.png) ![Stream Mode](/images/channels/dingtalk/04-stream-publish.png)

4. **App Release > Version Management** → create a new version and save
   ![Create Version](/images/channels/dingtalk/05-create-version.png)

5. **Basic Info > Credentials** → get **Client ID** (AppKey) and **Client Secret** (AppSecret)
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/dingtalk/06-credentials.png)

### Configure in MateClaw

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "DingTalk Bot",
    "type": "dingtalk",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "connection_mode": "stream",
      "client_id": "your-client-id",
      "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
      "message_type": "markdown"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
Stream mode uses the official DingTalk SDK to establish a WebSocket long connection. **No public IP required.** For AI Card streaming, set `message_type: card` and provide a template ID.
:::

### Find and use the bot

Search the bot name in DingTalk, find it under **Features**, start chatting.

![Search Bot](/images/channels/dingtalk/07-search-bot.png) ![Find Bot](/images/channels/dingtalk/08-find-bot.png) ![Chat](/images/channels/dingtalk/09-chat.png)

Webhook URL (webhook mode): `https://your-domain/api/v1/channels/webhook/dingtalk`

---

## Feishu (Lark)

WebSocket long connection or Webhook. WebSocket is preferred — no public IP required.

### One-click QR binding (recommended, v1.1.0+)

**Before: "go to the open platform → create an enterprise custom app → copy App ID and App Secret." After: click a button, scan the QR, credentials arrive.**

1. `Channels → New → choose type: Feishu`
2. In the form, click **Bind Feishu App via QR** — a QR code unfolds
3. Scan it with **the Feishu app** and **confirm authorization** (for Lark international, switch the domain to `lark`)
4. Back in the form, **App ID and App Secret are auto-filled**

Fill in the rest (agent, plus verification token / encrypt key if you're using webhook mode) as needed. **Sessions are valid for 5 minutes.**

::: tip What's happening under the hood
The Feishu SDK 2.6+ ships a `scene/registration` Device Flow. After bumping `com.larksuite.oapi:oapi-sdk` to 2.6.1, the entire "create app → copy credentials" detour collapses into a single QR scan.
:::

### Manual app creation (fallback)

If the QR flow can't reach Feishu on your network, or you need webhook mode / custom permission scopes:

1. Open [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/app), create an enterprise custom app
   ![Create App](/images/channels/feishu/01-create-app.png) ![App Info](/images/channels/feishu/02-build.png)

2. **Credentials & Basic Info** → grab **App ID** and **App Secret**
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/feishu/03-credentials.png)

3. **Capabilities** → enable **Bot**
   ![Enable Bot](/images/channels/feishu/04-enable-bot.png)

4. **Permissions** → batch-import:
   ![Permissions](/images/channels/feishu/05-permissions.png)

   ```json
   {
     "scopes": {
       "tenant": [
         "im:chat", "im:message", "im:message.group_msg",
         "im:message.p2p_msg:readonly", "im:resource",
         "contact:user.base:readonly"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Events & Callbacks** → select **WebSocket Long Connection** mode
   ![WebSocket Config](/images/channels/feishu/06-websocket.png)

6. Subscribe to **Receive Messages v2.0**
   ![Subscribe Event](/images/channels/feishu/07-subscribe-event.png)

7. **App Release** → create version and publish
   ![Create Version](/images/channels/feishu/08-create-version.png)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Feishu Bot",
    "type": "feishu",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "appId": "cli_your_app_id",
      "appSecret": "your-app-secret",
      "verificationToken": "your-verification-token",
      "encryptKey": "your-encrypt-key"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

## Telegram

Long-Polling (default) or Webhook. Long-Polling needs no public IP.

### Create bot

1. Search **@BotFather** in Telegram (look for the blue verified badge)
2. Send `/newbot`, follow the prompts
   ![Create Bot](/images/channels/telegram/01-botfather.jpg)
3. Copy the **Bot Token**
   ![Get Token](/images/channels/telegram/02-token.jpg)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Telegram Bot",
    "type": "telegram",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11",
      "show_typing": true,
      "polling_timeout": 20
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
- Long-Polling has exponential backoff reconnection (2s → 30s) built in
- Typing indicator is refreshed every 4 seconds
- Users in China may need `http_proxy` configured
:::

---

## Discord

Built on **JDA** — connects via Gateway WebSocket with automatic reconnection.

### Create bot

1. [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   ![Developer Portal](/images/channels/discord/01-developer-portal.png)

2. Create Application
   ![Create App](/images/channels/discord/02-create-app.png)

3. **Bot** → create a Bot, copy the **Token**
   ![Bot Token](/images/channels/discord/03-bot-token.png)

4. Enable **Message Content Intent**, grant **Send Messages** + **Attach Files**
   ![Permissions](/images/channels/discord/04-permissions.png)

5. **OAuth2 > URL Generator** → select `bot` scope → invite to your server
   ![OAuth2](/images/channels/discord/05-oauth2.png) ![Invite](/images/channels/discord/06-invite.png)

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Discord Bot",
    "type": "discord",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "your-bot-token",
      "accept_bot_messages": false
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

::: tip
- No Webhook URL or Interactions Endpoint needed — Gateway WebSocket handles everything
- Long replies (over 2000 characters) auto-split while preserving code block integrity
- Message deduplication (LRU cache of 500) prevents duplicate processing during reconnects
:::

---

## QQ

1. [QQ Open Platform](https://q.qq.com/) → create a bot application
   ![QQ Open Platform](/images/channels/qq/01-open-platform.png) ![Create Bot](/images/channels/qq/02-create-bot.png)

2. **Callback Configuration** → enable **C2C Message Event** and **Group Message AT Event**
   ![Event Config](/images/channels/qq/03-c2c-event.png)

3. **Development Management** → grab **AppID** and **AppSecret**
   ![Credentials](/images/channels/qq/04-credentials.png)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "QQ Bot",
    "type": "qq",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "appId": "your-app-id",
      "appSecret": "your-app-secret"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

---

## Slack

Events API (webhook mode) or Socket Mode (no public IP needed).

### Create app

1. Visit [Slack API — Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, grant bot scopes: `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `files:write`
3. Install the app to your workspace
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`)
5. For Socket Mode: under **Socket Mode**, enable it and generate an **App-Level Token** with `connections:write` (`xapp-...`)
6. Subscribe to bot events: `app_mention`, `message.im`

### Configure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Slack Bot",
    "type": "slack",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {
      "bot_token": "xoxb-...",
      "app_token": "xapp-...",
      "mode": "socket"
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

Webhook URL (webhook mode): `https://your-domain/api/v1/channels/webhook/slack`

## WeChat Personal (iLink)

::: warning
WeChat Personal Bot (iLink protocol) is in beta. Access must be applied for before use.
:::

- **Login** — QR code scan on first use; token persists automatically (across restarts)
- **Receiving** — HTTP long polling
- **Sending** — Reply via the `sendmessage` API (text + voice)

Add a WeChat Personal channel in Channel Management, click **Get Login QR Code**, scan with your phone. Token auto-fills on authorization.

### What it survives now

WeChat Personal used to be the flakiest channel. We rebuilt it:

- **Watchdog loop** — no silent pollers that stop reconnecting
- **Jittered exponential backoff** — auto-recovery on token expiry and network blips, no crash-and-stay-dead
- **Per-account staleness detection** — precisely identifies which account connection has gone stale
- **Voice transcription with 3 fallback paths** — covers WeChat CDN's multiple encryption schemes

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "WeChat Personal",
    "type": "weixin",
    "agentId": 1,
    "config": {"botToken": "your-bot-token"},
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

---

## Channel management API

```bash
# List
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Toggle
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels/1/toggle?enabled=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Health status (all channels)
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/channels/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

---

## Session source tracking

Every channel conversation records where it came from. In the session management view and the chat console, each session shows the corresponding channel icon. Sessions from IM channels belong to the `system` user.

---

## Voice for every channel

IM channels (WeCom, WeChat, DingTalk) support voice input. Transcription via DashScope or OpenAI Whisper, with multi-path fallback for WeChat's encrypted voice CDN. Voice replies are synthesized via text-to-speech and sent back as audio messages.

---

## Things worth knowing

- **Webhook mode needs HTTPS.** Production deployments should front MateClaw with Nginx + SSL.
- **Long-connection modes need no public IP.** Telegram Long-Polling, DingTalk Stream, Feishu WebSocket, Discord Gateway, Slack Socket mode, WeCom Long connection — all run behind NAT.
- **One channel, one agent.** Different channels can point at different agents.
- **Credentials are encrypted at rest** in `mate_channel`.
- **China networks** often need `http_proxy` configured for Telegram and Discord.
