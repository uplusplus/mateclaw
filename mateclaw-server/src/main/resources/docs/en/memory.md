# AI Memory System

**Memory is how the system gets better at knowing you.**

Everything else in MateClaw is static the moment you configure it. Agents, tools, knowledge bases — they change when you change them. Memory is the one part that changes on its own, as a byproduct of actual use. That's the whole point.

::: tip Your AI dreams about you while you sleep
That's not a marketing line. It's literal code in the `memory/dreaming/` package.

Every night at 2 AM (default; configurable) a scheduled job runs — its name is **Dreaming**. It walks every agent's conversation trail from the day, consolidates scattered signals into a coherent understanding of you, filters out one-offs and contradictions and stale facts, promotes recurring patterns into `MEMORY.md`, and appends "what it saw, what it concluded, what it rewrote" to `DREAMS.md` — a human-readable audit trail of how memory got to where it is today.

When you open MateClaw the next morning, it **picks up where yesterday left off** — not from zero.

> Every other AI starts each day from scratch. MateClaw continues from where yesterday ended.

This page covers the four layers that make up memory, the files the system writes for each agent, and how agents themselves read and write those files during a conversation.

---

## The four layers

```
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. This turn                                                │
  │     What you're saying, what was just said, auto-trimmed     │
  │     to the model's token budget                              │
  │     Updated: every turn                                      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (after conversation completes)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  2. Post-chat extraction                                     │
  │     Pulls the worth-keeping bits out of the conversation,    │
  │     writes them into PROFILE.md / MEMORY.md / today's note   │
  │     Updated: asynchronously, after each meaningful chat      │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (daily at 2:00 AM, configurable)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  3. Nightly consolidation (Dreaming)                         │
  │     Scans recent daily notes, finds recurring patterns,      │
  │     merges them into MEMORY.md, logs the run in DREAMS.md    │
  │     Updated: scheduled; manual trigger available             │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (next conversation picks up the latest)
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  4. Workspace files as system prompt                         │
  │     The four markdown files are injected every turn          │
  │     Updated: file changes take effect on the next turn       │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer operates at a different timescale. Short-term is *this turn*. Extraction is *after each conversation*. Consolidation is *nightly*. Workspace file injection is *every turn uses whatever's current*. Together they form a loop — what you say becomes context, context becomes files, files become system prompt, system prompt becomes what the agent knows tomorrow.

---

## Multi-layer memory with pluggable providers

The memory layer is not one hard-coded implementation. It's an **interface** — the multi-layer architecture lets you stack providers:

- The **default provider** is the workspace-file-based memory described in the rest of this page. It ships with MateClaw, and for most people it's all they'll ever need.
- **Custom providers** can be dropped in for specialized retrieval — vector-based long-term memory, graph memory, external memory services.
- **Layering** means a single agent can talk to multiple providers at once. A short-term provider returns recent context; a semantic provider returns related memories; a Wiki provider returns authoritative references. They compose at read time.

For most agents, **default is enough** and you should ignore this section. If you're building something specialized — an agent that needs to remember thousands of facts with vector search, an agent that needs graph-structured memory — this is where you plug in. See [Architecture](./architecture).

---

## The four files every agent has

Every agent has its own workspace. Four markdown files form the backbone of long-term memory:

```
workspace/{agentId}/
├── AGENTS.md          # How the agent uses memory — behavior guide
├── SOUL.md            # Who the agent is — core identity, personality, boundaries
├── PROFILE.md         # Who you are — user profile, preferences, background
├── MEMORY.md          # What matters — key decisions, project context, todos
└── memory/
    ├── 2026-04-09.md  # Daily notes — what happened today, append-only
    ├── 2026-04-10.md
    └── 2026-04-11.md
```

The first four are **injected into the system prompt on every turn** (if `enabled=true`). Daily notes are not — they feed consolidation instead.

### What each file is *for*

- **AGENTS.md** — the agent's user manual for itself. When to write memory, what goes where, what tools are available. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=0`.
- **SOUL.md** — who the agent fundamentally is. Self-awareness, evolution guidance, privacy and boundary principles. Edit when you want to change the agent's character at a deep level. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=1`.
- **PROFILE.md** — what the agent has learned about you. Name, occupation, tech stack, communication preferences. Updated by the extractor when conversations reveal something durable. Full-replace writes. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=2`.
- **MEMORY.md** — what the agent has decided matters enough to keep. Active projects, unresolved decisions, open threads, things you asked it to remember. Updated by both the extractor and the consolidator. Seed: `enabled=true`, `sort_order=3`.

::: tip New in 1.3.0: workflows can write memory
From v1.3.0, the [workflow](./workflow) `write_memory` step can write the run's output directly into an employee's `MEMORY.md` (or any enabled memory file) when the flow completes. Four merge strategies: `append` / `replace_section` / `upsert_kv` / `overwrite`. Memory is no longer written exclusively by the conversation extractor or the Dreaming consolidator — a business-process outcome can be persisted too.
:::

### Daily notes

Conversation highlights archived by date, in append mode — multiple conversations in one day concatenate into the same file. Not injected into the system prompt (`enabled=false`). They exist so the consolidator has something to scan at 2 AM.

---

## Short-term: the context window

Before every LLM call, MateClaw builds the prompt that actually gets sent:

```
[System Prompt]                        ← Always first
[Workspace file injection]             ← AGENTS / SOUL / PROFILE / MEMORY
[Conversation context summary]         ← Only if earlier turns got compressed
[Message 1: user]
[Message 2: assistant]
...
[Current user message]                 ← Always last
```

Workspace files are injected sorted by `sort_order`, formatted as:

```
--- AGENTS.md ---
(content)

--- SOUL.md ---
(content)

--- PROFILE.md ---
(content)

--- MEMORY.md ---
(content)
```

Only files with `enabled=true` are included.

### When context gets too big

Three-stage defense:

**Stage 1 — proactive compression.** When estimated total exceeds 75% of the budget (default window 128k tokens), the system calls the LLM to summarize earlier turns. The most recent 2 turns (4 messages) survive verbatim. The summary is cached for 30 minutes.

**Stage 2 — emergency recovery.** If the LLM still returns context-too-large, the system stops calling the LLM. It discards older messages, keeps the last 2 turns, and retries once.

**Stage 3 — hard trim.** If tokens are *still* over budget, messages drop from the front until the prompt fits. The last 2 messages are always preserved.

> **Security design** — the summary is injected as a **user message**, not a system message. Deliberate: preventing compressed historical user input from being elevated into system-level instructions eliminates an injection vector.

### Configuration

```yaml
mate:
  agent:
    conversation:
      window:
        default-max-input-tokens: 128000   # Global max
        compact-trigger-ratio: 0.75        # Compression trigger
        preserve-recent-pairs: 2           # Turns preserved verbatim
        summary-max-tokens: 300            # Compression budget
```

---

## Post-chat extraction

After a conversation ends, the system asynchronously pulls out what's memorable and writes it to PROFILE.md, MEMORY.md, and the day's daily note. This happens off the user-response path — it never blocks the next turn.

### What triggers it

After a turn completes, the system handles extraction on a background thread. A few preconditions must pass before it actually runs:

- Auto-summarize is on
- The conversation wasn't itself triggered by the consolidation cron job (avoids recursion)
- Message count meets the minimum (default 4)
- The last user message is long enough (default at least 10 chars)

All pass — extraction begins.

### Concurrency control

- **Cooldown** — same agent won't extract twice within 5 minutes (default)
- **Per-agent lock** — if an extraction is already running for this agent, the new request is skipped

### What the LLM actually does

1. Load conversation messages
2. Read current PROFILE.md, MEMORY.md, today's daily note
3. Build a transcript: up to 30 messages, each truncated to 2000 chars
4. Call the LLM with the memory-summarize prompt templates
5. Parse the JSON response
6. Apply writes

### LLM response schema

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `should_update` | boolean | Whether memory needs updating |
| `reason` | string | Why (for audit) |
| `daily_entry` | string | Content to append to today's daily note |
| `memory_update` | string | Full new content for MEMORY.md |
| `profile_update` | string | Full new content for PROFILE.md |

### File write rules

- **PROFILE.md** — full replace, only if `profile_update` is non-empty
- **MEMORY.md** — full replace, only if `memory_update` is non-empty
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — append, created with date heading if missing

---

## Consolidation and dreaming

The third layer runs on a schedule. Its job is to watch daily notes pile up and periodically ask: *what's the pattern here, what should be promoted into core memory, what's stale and should be forgotten?*

### What it does

1. Lists the agent's `memory/*.md` files, takes the most recent 7 days
2. Reads those + the current MEMORY.md
3. Calls the LLM with the consolidation prompt templates
4. The LLM returns `{should_update, reason, memory_content}`
5. If `should_update` is true, MEMORY.md is fully replaced

### Trigger methods

- **Automatic** — every agent has a row in the system's scheduled jobs, set to run nightly at 2 AM
- **Manual** — `POST /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/emergence`

### Why it's not recursive

Consolidation triggers a "conversation" through the agent. Without protection, that conversation would re-trigger the post-chat extraction listener, which would trigger another conversation, ad infinitum.

The event carries a trigger-source flag. The extraction listener sees that the conversation was started by the consolidation job and skips it.

### DREAMS.md — the consolidation diary

Each consolidation run appends a short entry to `workspace/{agentId}/DREAMS.md`:

- what it looked at
- what patterns it found
- what changed in MEMORY.md
- the date

Human-readable audit trail — open DREAMS.md and see *how* the memory got to its current state. Caps its own growth; old entries get summarized when the file exceeds a threshold.

### Scored emergence and recall tracking

Consolidation tracks:

- **Which memory entries were actively recalled** in recent conversations — read patterns feed back into importance
- **Scored emergence** — candidate patterns ranked by frequency + recency + explicit recall, only high-scoring ones make it into MEMORY.md
- **Multi-gate filtering** — low-signal extractions (one-off mentions, contradictions, things the user later corrected) get filtered before becoming memory
- **Dreaming status API** — `GET /api/v1/memory/{agentId}/dreaming/status`

### Full lifecycle (opt-in via flag)

Memory grows from "dream nightly" to a complete turn-by-turn lifecycle. This behavior lands behind feature flags — default off in the open-source build, on in production builds.

What it does:

- **Every turn is bookkept** — the system takes notes at the start and end of every turn, not just at nightly consolidation
- **Fact projection** — conversations are projected into structured "fact" rows the agent can query. Trust scoring + decay built in.
- **Structured nightly report** — consolidation produces a full report; you can re-consolidate by topic on demand
- **Morning card** — the first conversation of the day surfaces yesterday's report; you Confirm / Edit / Forget each fact
- **Contradiction inbox** — when new facts conflict with old ones, you get a queue instead of silent overwrites
- **Explicit forget** — say "forget that," and it actually forgets, everywhere
- **Feedback scoring** — thumbs up/down on retrieved facts feeds back into trust
- **SOUL auto-evolution** — the agent's persona file rewrites itself from accumulated facts
- **Monthly archive** — old reports roll into a compressed monthly archive, browsable in the timeline
- **Memory Browser** — timeline, facts, contradictions, diff viewer, and a trust bar across the top

Enable in `application.yml`:

```yaml
mateclaw:
  memory:
    dream-v2:
      enabled: true
      fact-projection: true
      contradictions: true
      morning-card: true
```

## Agents reading and writing their own memory

Memory isn't just something that *happens to* an agent. The agent itself can actively read and write its own files during a conversation, through a set of workspace memory tools:

| Method | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `list_workspace_memory_files` | List files, optional filename prefix filter, sorted by `sort_order` |
| `read_workspace_memory_file` | Read a specific file's content |
| `write_workspace_memory_file` | Create or overwrite a file (full replace) |
| `edit_workspace_memory_file` | Find-and-replace edit (incremental, `replaceAll` supported) |

### Examples

**List:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filenamePrefix": "memory/"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "count": 3, "files": [
  {"filename": "memory/2026-04-09.md", "enabled": false, "fileSize": 512},
  ...
]}
```

**Read:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "enabled": true, "content": "..."}
```

**Edit:**

```json
// in
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "oldText": "old", "newText": "new"}
// out
{"agentId": 1, "filename": "MEMORY.md", "replacements": 1}
```

### Safety rules

- `.md` files only
- No absolute paths, no `..` directory traversal
- `write` is a full overwrite — read first if you care about existing content
- Newly created files have `enabled=false` by default
