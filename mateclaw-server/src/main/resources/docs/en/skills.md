# Skills

**A skill is a tool that thinks in sentences.**

Tools are atomic — read a file, send an HTTP request, run a command. Skills are compositions — "research this topic and write a brief", "review this code and comment on it", "turn my git log into a standup update". A skill is a `SKILL.md` file that combines instructions, parameters, prompt templates, optional scripts, and a list of tools the skill needs. The runtime loads it, renders it with your inputs, and hands the result to the agent.

If tools are hands, skills are recipes.

## Five kinds of skills

| Type | Where it comes from | Who maintains it |
|------|--------------------|------------------|
| **`builtin`** | Ships with MateClaw under `skills/` in the classpath | The core team |
| **`custom`** | Created by you through the UI, API, or dropping a file into the workspace | You |
| **`dynamic`** | Auto-synthesized by agents during work | The agent + your approval |
| **`mcp`** | Backed by a tool exposed from an MCP server (a same-name `custom` skill shadows it) | The MCP server author |
| **`acp`** | Bridged from an external Agent Client Protocol endpoint (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) | The upstream agent service |

All five flow through the same runtime pipeline. Only the source differs.

## The SKILL.md protocol

Every skill is one Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter is the contract. The body is the prompt.

```markdown
---
name: web-researcher
title: Web Researcher
description: Search the web and summarize findings on a given topic
version: 1.0.0
type: custom
author: your-name
tools:
  - WebSearchTool
  - ReadFileTool
tags:
  - research
  - search
parameters:
  - name: topic
    type: string
    required: true
    description: The topic to research
  - name: depth
    type: string
    required: false
    default: brief
    description: Level of detail (brief, detailed, comprehensive)
---

# Web Researcher

You are a web research assistant. When given a topic, you should:

1. Use WebSearchTool to find relevant information about {{topic}}
2. Evaluate source credibility
3. Compile findings into a {{depth}} summary
4. Include source URLs in your response

## Output Format

Present your findings as:
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview
- **Key Facts**: Bullet-point list
- **Sources**: Numbered list of URLs
```

Two things to notice. First, the body is a prompt — not a description of one. It's what the skill will say to the agent at runtime, with `{{topic}}` and `{{depth}}` filled in. Second, the `tools:` list is a contract: the runtime guarantees those tools are available when the skill runs. If the agent doesn't have them, the skill call fails early with a clear error.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | ✅ | Unique identifier (kebab-case) |
| `title` | ✅ | Human-readable display name |
| `description` | ✅ | One-line summary |
| `version` | ✅ | Semantic version |
| `type` | ✅ | `builtin`, `custom`, `mcp` |
| `author` | — | Skill author |
| `tools` | — | List of tool names the skill requires |
| `tags` | — | Categorization |
| `parameters` | — | Typed input parameters |

### Parameter schema

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | ✅ | Parameter name (used in `{{name}}` interpolation) |
| `type` | ✅ | `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array` |
| `required` | — | Whether it must be provided (default: false) |
| `default` | — | Fallback value if caller omits |
| `description` | ✅ | What the parameter controls |

## The runtime pipeline

```
1. RESOLVE     Look up the skill by name in mate_skill
       │
       ▼
2. VALIDATE    Check that required parameters are provided
       │
       ▼
3. RENDER      Replace {{parameter}} placeholders in the SKILL.md body
       │
       ▼
4. INJECT      Append the rendered instructions to the agent's system prompt
       │
       ▼
5. BIND TOOLS  Verify required tools are available; fail fast if missing
       │
       ▼
6. EXECUTE     The agent processes the enriched prompt with bound tools
```

Skills don't run scripts by default — they **shape the agent's behavior** for the duration of the call. The agent's next reasoning step sees the skill's rendered instructions as part of its system prompt. The exception is skills that ship with a script — `SkillScriptTool` can execute a skill's bundled script file, gated by Tool Guard.

### Template rendering

Skill bodies support `{{parameterName}}` placeholders. With `{topic: "quantum computing", depth: "detailed"}`:

```markdown
Research the topic "{{topic}}" at a {{depth}} level of detail.
```

…renders to:

```markdown
Research the topic "quantum computing" at a detailed level of detail.
```

Missing parameters fall back to defaults. Unknown placeholders are left intact.

## Skill storage

The database is the source of truth, the filesystem is a materialized cache. That's always been the rule for **SKILL.md**, and **as of v1.3 it applies to scripts/ and references/ too**.

### Database: `mate_skill` + `mate_skill_file`

`mate_skill` — skill identity and body:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `name` | Unique name |
| `title` | Display title |
| `description` | One-line summary |
| `type` | `builtin` / `custom` / `mcp` |
| `content` | Full `SKILL.md` content |
| `version` | Semantic version |
| `enabled` | On/off |
| `tags` | JSON array |
| `create_time` / `update_time` | Timestamps |

`mate_skill_file` (new in v1.3, migration `V112`) — the **canonical copy** of every bundle file:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `skill_id` | FK to `mate_skill` |
| `file_path` | Relative path like `scripts/run.py` or `references/cfg.md` |
| `content` | UTF-8 text (≤1 MB per file, ≤50 MB per bundle) |
| `content_size` | Byte count (so listings don't have to load the blob) |
| `sha256` | Content fingerprint, drives the syncer's idempotent diff |

### Filesystem: skill workspace

```
~/.mateclaw/skills/
├── translate/
│   ├── SKILL.md               # Skill definition
│   ├── references/            # Reference materials
│   └── scripts/               # Optional executable scripts
├── code-review/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── ...
└── .archived/                 # Archived old versions
    └── translate-20260401-143000/
```

Think of it as "Maven Local Repository, but for skills" — except the local repo can now hydrate itself from the database.

### Auto-sync on startup

Two sync passes run at boot, so every node has the latest bundle:

1. `SkillWorkspaceBootstrapRunner` → `BundledSkillSyncer` scans the classpath `skills/` directory and syncs **bundled skills** into the workspace root. **Only syncs when the target directory doesn't exist**, so it never clobbers local modifications.
2. `SkillFileSyncer` diffs `mate_skill_file` (DB) against the local workspace (FS) by `sha256` and materializes anything missing or stale.

**Why this matters for multi-instance deployments**: one node accepts the upload, the DB row + file rows are written, every other node either restarts or hits `POST /api/v1/skills/{id}/sync-files` to receive the full bundle. No NFS, no scp loop, even desktop clients can hand a skill off across machines.

> Upgrade path: pre-v1.3 installs have files on disk but no `mate_skill_file` rows. The first time `SkillFileSyncer` runs on a freshly upgraded node, it **backfills from disk** into the canonical store; from then on the two stay in lockstep.

### Robust zip install

Third-party packagers package weirdly — some put `setup.sh` at the zip root, some emit `scripts/` entries before `SKILL.md`. As of v1.3, `ZipSkillFetcher`:

- **Two-pass extraction** — the entire archive is buffered in memory first (cap-protected at 50 MB), `SKILL.md` is located and the wrapper-dir prefix computed, then entries are classified. **Zip entry order no longer affects the result.**
- **Root-level extension fallback** — files sitting next to `SKILL.md` that aren't already under a known bucket get classified by extension: `.sh / .py / .js / .rb / ...` → `scripts/`, `.md / .json / .yaml / .csv / ...` → `references/`. Unknown extensions are dropped with a `WARN` line so packaging mistakes surface instead of vanishing.
- **Write-then-prune + empty-bundle guard** — reinstalls **write new files first, then prune anything in the bucket that's not in the new bundle**. If the new bundle has zero entries for a bucket (`scripts/` or `references/`), the disk copies for that bucket are **left alone** — a malformed re-extract can no longer wipe your scripts. Pass `forcePrune=true` if you really want to clear a bucket via an intentionally empty bundle.

> Real failure this catches: the official tencent-meeting-mcp zip puts `setup.sh` at the package root (not under `scripts/`). The old extractor silently dropped it; the new one auto-classifies it as `scripts/setup.sh` and the skill installs ready to run.

### Configuration

```yaml
mateclaw:
  skill:
    workspace:
      root: ${user.home}/.mateclaw/skills
      auto-init: true
      delete-policy: archive                 # `archive` or `ignore`
      bundled-skills-path: skills
```

## Skill Market (and ClawHub)

The **Skill Market** page (`/skills`) is where you browse, install, edit, and manage skills. Three sources:

- **Built-in** — skills that ship with MateClaw
- **Your custom skills** — the ones you created
- **ClawHub** — a community skill repository. Browse thousands of community skills, preview them, install with one click. Installed skills land as `custom` type.

ClawHub is optional — if you're offline or don't want external skills, just don't touch that tab.

---

## Skill Market API

```bash
# List all skills
curl http://localhost:18088/api/v1/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Create a custom skill
curl -X POST http://localhost:18088/api/v1/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "code-reviewer",
    "title": "Code Reviewer",
    "description": "Review code for bugs, style issues, and improvements",
    "type": "custom",
    "content": "---\nname: code-reviewer\n...",
    "tags": ["development", "review"]
  }'

# Enable / disable
curl -X PUT http://localhost:18088/api/v1/skills/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'

# Delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:18088/api/v1/skills/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Delete policy is configurable — by default, deletion moves the skill workspace to `.archived/` rather than erasing it.

## Writing a custom skill — step by step

1. **Decide what the skill does.** One sentence.
2. **List the tools it needs.** Three or fewer is a good target.
3. **Write the parameters.** Required ones first, optional with defaults.
4. **Write the body.** Address the agent directly: *"You are X. When given Y, do Z."*
5. **Upload** via the Skill Market UI or API.
6. **Bind** the skill to one or more agents.
7. **Test** by sending a message that should trigger the skill.

Example — "Daily Standup" skill:

```markdown
---
name: daily-standup
title: Daily Standup Generator
description: Generate a daily standup update based on recent git activity
version: 1.0.0
type: custom
tools:
  - ShellExecuteTool
parameters:
  - name: repo_path
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Path to the git repository
---

# Daily Standup Generator

Generate a standup update by analyzing recent git activity.

## Steps

1. Run `git log --oneline --since="yesterday" --author=$(git config user.name)`
   in the directory {{repo_path}}
2. Summarize completed work
3. Identify any work-in-progress branches
4. Format as a standup update:
   - **Yesterday**: What was completed
   - **Today**: What is planned based on open branches
   - **Blockers**: Any merge conflicts or failing tests
```

---

## Workspace isolation

Each workspace gets its own copy of skills. When you enable a skill for a workspace, its files are staged under that workspace's directory, the skill's tools are scoped to that workspace, and any file the skill writes stays inside the workspace boundary. See [Workspaces](./workspaces).

---

## Auto Skill Synthesis

Agents that work with you long enough start noticing patterns — a recurring database query, a particular report layout, the exact commands to SSH into your box. Agents can **turn those patterns into skills on their own**.

The flow:

1. The agent recognizes a reusable workflow during task execution
2. The agent proposes a new skill (create / edit / patch / delete)
3. You review in ChatConsole — check the content, rename if you want, approve or reject
4. On approval, the skill saves as `dynamic` type, ready for reuse

**Security scan runs automatically before save** — dangerous patterns (prompt injection, script injection) are blocked. Skills can migrate between agents and export as ZIP.

The agent's memory grows with you. No more repeating "remember I like tables sorted this way."

---

## Template wizard: start from a starter

Don't know how to write a SKILL.md? Open the wizard.

`Skills → Create Wizard`:

1. Pick a **starter template** (8 of them: researcher, code reviewer, writing assistant, customer-support script, data analysis, Claude Code helper, Codex helper, blank)
2. Fill in the variables — name, parameters, a few sentences of description
3. Upload any supporting files (scripts, references, prompt fragments)
4. Set secrets (API keys, etc.) — **secrets go to a vault, not into SKILL.md**
5. Save

You don't get just a SKILL.md. You get a **multi-file bundle** — SKILL.md, references/, scripts/, secret references — packaged together.

---

## Pre-flight check before installation

A skill that's installed isn't necessarily a skill that runs — it might need an API key, a CLI tool, a MateClaw feature flag toggled on.

Used to be: install, run, fail, debug. Now:

**Pre-flight install dialog** — runs the prerequisite check automatically before the skill goes live:

- Are the required tools present?
- Are the required API keys configured?
- Are the required feature flags on?
- Are the dependent MCP / ACP endpoints reachable?

Whatever's missing is reported up front, with a one-click **`[Set Up]`** button that jumps to the right config page. **No more install-then-debug.**

---

## LESSONS.md: skills that learn from experience

Each skill can carry a `LESSONS.md` — what the skill learned during runs.

- After a run, the skill can **proactively write a lesson**: "Last time the user didn't like that format, don't do it again"
- Next time the same skill is invoked, LESSONS get auto-injected into the prompt context
- The more it's used, the better it knows **when to step in and when to stay out**

This is the first cut of skill self-evolution. Skills go from a list of instructions to something with playbooks, experience, and the capacity to grow.

LESSONS are viewable and editable in the skill detail drawer's **Memory tab**.

---

## Secrets: put the token in the right place

Lots of skills need API credentials to function — tencent-meeting needs `TENCENT_MEETING_TOKEN`, Slack needs a bot token, Linear needs a personal API key. Those values **don't belong in SKILL.md** (it goes into the prompt and leaks to the LLM), don't belong in scripts (one git push and you're sorry), and editing `~/.zshrc` requires restarting the server and won't follow the skill across machines.

As of v1.3, every skill has its own **per-skill secret store**.

### Manage it in the UI

Skill detail drawer → **Secrets** tab. One table plus a form:

```
Key                        Value         Last updated     Actions
TENCENT_MEETING_TOKEN     sk••••ef      2026-05-12       [Edit] [Delete]

[+ Add secret]
```

- **Plaintext never leaves the server** — listing returns only `preview` (`sk••••ef`-style mask); the add/edit dialog's value field starts blank, saving overwrites whatever was there.
- **Client-side validation** — keys must match `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,127}$`; bad keys are rejected in the browser before submission.
- **Value field is `<input type="password" autocomplete="off">`** — shoulder-surfers, screenshots, and password managers all stay out.

### How it's stored / how it's injected

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| Write | `POST /api/v1/skills/{id}/secrets` `{key, value}` → AES-encrypted → `mate_skill_secret` |
| Read | Before subprocess launch, `SkillSecretService.getDecrypted(skillId)` AES-decrypts |
| Inject | `ProcessBuilder.environment().putAll(...)` — **overrides parent-process env vars of the same name** |

The injection rule is **secret-store wins, `.zshrc` is the fallback**. For multi-user / multi-machine deployments, desktop clients, and corporate accounts that don't share databases, the secret store is the more reliable source of truth.

### REST endpoints

```bash
# List (masked)
GET    /api/v1/skills/{id}/secrets
# Upsert (empty value deletes)
POST   /api/v1/skills/{id}/secrets   {"key":"...", "value":"..."}
# Delete
DELETE /api/v1/skills/{id}/secrets/{key}
```

### A full example: tencent-meeting

```
SkillMarket → tencent-meeting-mcp card → detail drawer → Secrets tab
  → + Add secret → key=TENCENT_MEETING_TOKEN, value=<paste your token>
  → Save

Then when the agent runs setup.sh or scripts/tencent_meeting.py:
  ProcessBuilder env carries $TENCENT_MEETING_TOKEN
  → mcporter / Python script calls the Tencent API → meeting ID returned
```

No `~/.zshrc` edit, no mateclaw restart needed.

---

## Discoverability: a skill installed should be a skill found

Installing a new skill used to mean the agent often couldn't find it. Three causes, three fixes, all in v1.3.

### 1) New skills are **boosted** in the prompt catalog

The agent's system prompt carries a compact Skills table. Each model gets a row cap based on its max input tokens — qwen-turbo with 8192 tokens gets only **8 entries**. A brand-new skill has zero usage history, so the existing recent / frequent / RECOMMENDED sort buries it behind ~40 older skills, well below the cutoff.

v1.3 inserts a "**installed in the last 7 days**" sort key at the front of the ranker. Install on Friday, the skill is still in the first frame on Monday — long enough to span a weekend, short enough not to occupy a slot indefinitely. Builtins and virtual MCP/ACP rows are excluded (you didn't "just install" them).

### 2) `listAvailableSkills()` teaches the LLM how to search wider

The tool description now explicitly says:

- The default page is 20 entries; if you see `Showing: 20 of 47`, **retry with `keyword=<part of name>` or `limit=50`**
- If the user mentions a specific skill name, **skip the catalog** — go straight to `readSkillFile(skillName="<exact-name>", filePath="SKILL.md")` to verify

Truncated results carry a one-line hint at the end so even small models can see how to follow up.

### 3) Calling a skill name as a tool **auto-redirects**

LLMs occasionally call a skill name as if it were a tool (`tencent-meeting-mcp({...})`). The previous behavior was a textual hint telling them to call `readSkillFile` instead — which qwen-turbo-class models often can't act on. They reply "let me get that for you" and end the turn without any further tool call, producing a dead loop.

As of v1.3, when `ToolExecutionExecutor` sees this case AND `readSkillFile` is bound to the agent, it **transparently invokes readSkillFile on the LLM's behalf** and returns the SKILL.md content (prefixed with `[auto-redirect]` and the original args echoed back) as the tool result. The model has runnable instructions in front of it on its very first attempt and goes straight to `runSkillScript`, no loop.

> This fix helps small models a lot and doesn't hurt large models (they would have followed the textual hint anyway).

---

## ACP bridge: plug in external coding agents

ACP (Agent Client Protocol) is a protocol that lets external agent clients (Claude Code, Codex, other compatible clients) plug into MateClaw as skills.

Once installed:

- ACP endpoints **auto-bridge into skill cards** — they show up on the Skills page with a wrapper toolset
- **Visual env editor** — every endpoint's required key, URL, CWD, configurable in the UI
- **Per-session cwd** — every ACP session has its own working directory
- **Errors translated** — upstream messages like "Request not allowed" get translated into something actionable
- **OAuth keychain hijack detection** — if your OAuth token has been hijacked by another app, you're prompted to re-authenticate

Templates: `claude-code-helper`, `codex-helper` — install and go.

A digital employee calls an ACP skill the same way it calls a built-in tool.

---

## Detail drawer: everything in one place

Every skill card opens a drawer with eight tabs:

- **Overview** — identity fields, manifest projection, source, version
- **Body** — `SKILL.md` editor (takes over the full drawer width)
- **Tools** — which tools this skill uses (with effective tool expansion)
- **Features** — capability matrix
- **Security** — content scan results, related Tool Guard rules
- **Lessons** — `LESSONS.md` content
- **Secrets** — env-var-style credentials (new in v1.3; see the "Secrets" section below)
- **Memory** — digital employees bound to this skill

The card itself is slim — six fields and one status pill. **Clear beats comprehensive.**

---

## Security

Custom skills go through several checks before they become live:

- **Content scanning** — `SKILL.md` scanned for prompt injection and script injection on upload
- **Tool requirement check** — `tools:` list must only reference tools that exist
- **Tool Guard compliance** — skills with dangerous tools inherit Tool Guard rules
- **MCP skill constraints** — MCP-backed skills inherit the security constraints of their MCP server

Full review in [Security & Approval](./security).

## Next

- [Agents](./agents) — how agents invoke skills during a turn
- [MCP](./mcp) — MCP-backed skills
